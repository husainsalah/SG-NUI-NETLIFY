          Alia Benabdellah, Docteure en Géographie Humaine, in conversation with musician and artist Scott Grooves on
          August 8, 2023
        </p>
        <NDivider></NDivider>
        <p class="pt-8">
          On the occasion of Grooves’ second solo exhibition, writer, and music scholar Alia Benabdellah had the
          opportunity to sit down at La Ventana Cafe with Scott Grooves to explore his newfound passion for visual art
          and delve into his unique connection between electronic music and personal expression. During their
          conversation, Grooves shared his insights and perspectives on this creative journey, shedding light on the
          intriguing intersection of different art forms.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          “I saw the Heidelberg project for the first time. That is not far from my old neighborhood. I do remember
          being very in awe. Because it didn't feel exactly like art. It felt like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia,
          like something that is living and just growing. I grew up in an environment that began to look similar to
          that, where it was just very industrial, very ready-made, with a very similar aesthetic.” - Scott Grooves
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          Alia: Hey Scott, thank you for taking the time, this conversation is going to be focused on your visual art
          and your creative perspective. I wanted to ask a very general question to start: how did you come to music and
          art? What were your musical and artistic influences growing up and then later in life?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          Scott: I grew up in a musical family; my family consisted of musicians and artists. So, I essentially had a
          dual identity. Music was a constant presence in my upbringing, and my father was a traditional portrait
          painter. I have distinct memories of being attracted to album cover artwork, the visual components of albums.
          This fascination was among my earliest experiences of the convergence of visual and musical art forms.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          Alia: You're anticipating my questions [laughs]. I wanted to ask you to give me a few artworks that left you a
          striking memory and that you still remember today.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          Scott: Bob James is one that really struck me you know, struck me really well [showing me Bob James’ artwork
          for his album Two released in 1975]. Especially the artwork with a gold hand holding an apple, that's a very
          visual strong statement for me. I really like Ronnie Laws Friends and Strangers album cover. As I got older, I
          was really drawn to this group called Change, they were an 80s group, but they always had Kandinsky style
          artwork on all of their albums. They had a particular style to it. It always caught my eye. When I was in high
          school, I would just take an album cover and try to draw it and emulate it. That helped me practice my
          artistic skills. I would take an album cover, sit it down and try to draw it and copy it as close to the
          original as possible. I've always remembered looking at album covers.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. It sounds like you are very much influenced by the visual aspect of music, almost as much as the sonic
          aspect itself?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. During that period, I was a teenager, and the combination of music and videos gained immense popularity.
          Visual elements began to accompany music more prominently, as the majority of the songs I heard on the radio
          were accompanied by videos. At times, these videos were just as captivating as the music itself, often leaving
          a strong impression due to their incredible nature.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Could you give me a few examples of artists in general, musicians, visual artists, that influenced you,
          that were big influences on you and still are?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I draw inspiration from a multitude of artists, and narrowing down that list is quite a challenge.
          Countless artists have played a significant role in shaping my work and revitalizing my creativity. On a
          related note, I read Stevie Wonder's biography, which provided a valuable lesson: that even without sight, an
          artist can maintain their vision and artistic integrity. Another figure that deeply resonated with me is David
          Drake, a pottery maker whose story connected with me on multiple levels. Additionally, the documentary 'When
          Dylan Went Electric' offered me a learning experience..
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. I want to ask a question about Detroit, and the role of the city in your creation, about its artistic
          power, its creative power. We talked about that many times and I remember a conversation that we had that I
          found really powerful where you were saying that Detroit was like an island and its people were trapped by
          boundaries like Eight Mile. And you were bouncing off of each other like molecules. Could you comment on that?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Detroit, in terms of its geography, gave me the sense of being an island, and at times, an uncharted one.
          The city's geographical layout, with certain areas featuring numerous abandoned houses - though not across all
          neighborhoods - resulted in an almost open and uninhabited feel. It's intriguing how this would be depicted on
          present-day Google Maps, considering many of these areas seem disconnected. The island-like quality emerged
          due to defining factors like Eight Mile Road. This proximity also infused an energetic atmosphere, as a
          diverse array of global music managed to find its way into the city, transcending the physical confines and
          broadening our perspectives. I viewed each of our studios as small-scale nuclear reactors, with molecules
          colliding to produce something vibrant and energetic.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Yes and in comparison, to other cities, it did seem kind of small. Yet so very creative. So many people are
          creative here. Big talents.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. In my youth, creativity was an integral part of my life due to its connection to resourcefulness. It wasn't
          just about being creative; my imagination had a dual role of being both creative and resourceful. I grew up in
          a neighborhood where resources were limited among most of us. This situation led us to rely on each other for
          support, fostering a great deal of creativity, as our imagination had to account for both inventiveness and
          resourcefulness. I distinctly recall how my parents demonstrated resourcefulness, and this quality continues
          to shape my imagination today. I learned to utilize what was available instead of yearning for something else.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          One of my earliest artistic memories revolves around feeling like a toy maker. Even though my parents didn't
          purchase many toys for me, it didn't hinder my playtime. I often crafted my own toys, participating in what
          felt like an underground toy-making scene. Schoolmates would share their creations, inspiring me to go home
          and attempt to replicate them. This process allowed me to repurpose broken toys into new forms, displaying an
          early inclination for reimagining and transforming objects. This mindset continues to influence much of my
          present work, rooted in the childhood joy of crafting and finding enjoyment through self-created amusements.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Do you remember going to the DIA or artistic places in Detroit, growing up?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. Yes. In school, we would have field trips to museums.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Do you remember your feelings in front of this very classical art?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I don't actually remember the feelings, but I do remember going to museums and being told not to touch
          anything. That sticks out of my mind because I think I was the kind of kid that you had to tell that to,
          otherwise I would touch it. But I do remember this “don't touch anything” rule. That supersedes anything that
          I saw. The warning. “Do not touch”. I don't know for some reason that’s what I remember more than the art.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Because it's very exclusive if you think about it. It’s a very exclusive requirement to appreciate art.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. I would think so. Absolutely. Far away from building an underground.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. How can music, Scott, inspire the making of art according to you?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I believe it originates from the same source, deriving from creativity and imagination. For me, it's a very
          visual phenomenon. When I wake up, I don't always fixate on the exact direction I'll take. Instead, I
          recognize that I'll take an idea and let it unfold, whether visually, musically, or even in the form of
          clothing design. It's like working with raw material that can find expression through various mediums. Through
          reflection, I determine the best application for each idea.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          Both music and art are inherently artistic forms, naturally coexisting in numerous realms. They mutually
          contribute to each other's narratives and engagement—this is indisputable. As I delve further into my journey
          within both domains, I'll explore this connection in greater depth. I recall how I spent more time gazing at
          the album cover of Ronnie Laws' 'Friends And Strangers' than listening to the music; such was the impact of
          the imagery. The same sentiment applies to works like Stevie Wonder's 'Innervisions,' for instance.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          In 2021, I received my inaugural commission from Japanese electronic artist Takeshi Fukishima to design the
          cover art for his release, 'Above The Blue.' I aspire to create more artworks tied to musical projects like
          this in the future. Art and music share a common language of expression, each offering distinct avenues to
          convey thoughts, emotions, and stories. The symbiotic relationship between these creative forms amplifies
          their individual resonance and fosters an immersive encounter for the audience. The convergence of art and
          music generates a potent fusion, igniting the senses and enriching the overall artistic encounter.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Do you think because you've first been a musician that this influences you in a bigger matter than the
          visual aspect? Or like you said, it was all about your creativity in different phases? Do you think that music
          element is really what brought you to artistic creativity?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. It's likely so. In my perspective, music functions as an ongoing soundtrack, running alongside every facet
          of my life. This continuous presence parallels everything I do. However, all of this stems from a singular
          source: my imagination. To me, my imagination embodies both creativity and resourcefulness. Remarkably, it
          remains uncharted and unmapped, a realm that continues to offer avenues of exploration. Whether I'm engaging
          in music or art, monotony is absent, as I lack a predefined, step-by-step approach. With music, I must
          acknowledge a phase when it began to adopt a tutorial-like structure, where I followed a sequence of steps.
          Conversely, my artistic side drastically contrasts as I have not engaged in it for an extensive period. This
          aspect feels highly improvisational, a quality that became particularly liberating when I dedicated myself to
          daily artistic endeavors during the lockdown. Even though both creative outlets originate from the same mental
          source, I gravitated toward art on a daily basis.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Do you think that the pandemic and its distorted relation to time during this very particular moment
          contributed to you being able to take another artistic direction?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Absolutely. I took the time because I had the time. You couldn't have the excuse that you didn't have the
          time.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. How did you start making art during that period?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I don't know what made me just start doing art every day. It wasn't like I just woke up and verbally said
          it to myself. I just started painting. I don't know where that exactly came from. I still think about that. I
          just remember going to the art supply store in June 2021 and buying some supplies and that was it. But I don't
          know what made me come to this conclusion. I just started to do it. Maybe it was because I did have the time
          and the isolation because of the pandemic, and my imagination dictated as such. But that's what I started to
          do daily. And there was less music making every day, which was not a bad thing because it feels all the same
          to me sometimes.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. You don't see a separation between the two?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. No, a lot of times I don't. But sometimes I can feel the separation.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. How do you approach art making vs music making? What you already explained makes me think that the art
          making process takes more time than making music. Which is also connected to the fact you have so much
          experience in music.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. My approach to creating art encompasses numerous paths, often excluding music from the initial equation. My
          artistic process defies a rigid step-by-step method, a departure I am grateful for. Instead, my mindset
          operates analogically, enabling me to draw connections from unexpected sources. For instance, watching a
          documentary about brick-making might trigger an idea that I can apply to an art concept I've conceived. On
          occasions, these analogies can transcend both music and art, yielding a dual benefit. An interesting
          observation I've made is that my artwork began flowing more freely when I embraced a less deliberate approach.
          Painting felt intuitive; I wasn't caught up in overthinking. Upon reflection, I realized that I created art
          without excessive contemplation, in contrast to my approach to music. When engaging with music, I distinctly
          remember making real-time decisions about every aspect of a composition. However, with art, the process was
          almost inversely organic; I found myself not thinking deeply. This ability to operate without overthinking is
          a skill I've honed since childhood. Even today's kids, I believe, share this inclination. When I was younger,
          visiting a playground involved simply playing, without an excessive focus on how to play.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. True!</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. My parents would let me out of the car at the playground and I would go play. And think about it, there is
          not one kid that stands there at the seesaw for a long time, and thinks about how to play on it. You don't
          have to teach a kid how to play. And I can readily tell that this “play” was coming out in my art. It wasn't
          coming out so much in my music. The music started to become more strategic. I was thinking about it, maybe
          because I've been doing this so long. But when I started to do the art, it made me feel like I was that kid
          just playing free.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Do you remember when you first started to make music? The feeling, would you say, was similar or still
          different?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. When I first started making music, I was trying to make music like the music I heard. With art, it wasn't
          like that. I wasn't trying to create the Mona Lisa. I wasn't. So there was a difference there. But when I
          started music, yeah, I was trying to make music like the music I heard. I was trying to make music like that.
          And in that process, I found my own voice. And that was a good thing. But with art, it's just like I went to a
          playground, and I started to play. And if you ever watch children on a playground, sometimes they play totally
          different than you as an adult think they should. As a child, I would totally go up the slide the other way. I
          wouldn't slide down. I would try to go up. I would always do just the opposite because there's no rules. There
          were no instructions on how to play at a playground. And I'm still like that today, with my art especially. I
          just go for it. During the lockdown, that was my daily activity. And that felt really good. And I think it
          balanced out the way I operate with some of my music. I started to feel a nice balance.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Are there any particular spaces, particular experiences with architecture that you thought about when you
          were approached to do your exhibition? And have you been to exhibitions on this planet that left you also
          lasting memories?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Let me answer the last one first. Some of my ideas come by way of location. When I visited Red Door Digital
          for the first time a couple of my ideas for the upcoming exhibition came into focus by just looking at the
          space and its cool brick architecture. Going back in time, I do remember being really struck when I saw the
          Heidelberg project for the first time. That is not far from my old neighborhood. I do remember being very in
          awe. Because it didn't feel exactly like art. It felt like the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, like something
          that is living and just growing. I grew up in an environment that began to look similar to that, where it was
          just very industrial, very ready-made, with a very similar aesthetic. When I saw the Heidelberg project, I was
          really struck by that. I really was.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. The other question was, were there any particular spaces or particular experiences with architecture that
          you talk about when you approach your own exhibitions?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. That's a good question. Like I said, I grew up in a very industrial part of Detroit, so the buildings and
          how they look, especially when they're starting to not be maintained, and the paint and the layers start to
          come off, is definitely something that I saw on a daily basis. And you will see the old sign before they
          painted it with the new sign. Lots of buildings, and old factories scattered around. This has always been in
          my visual memory ever since I can remember. My visual language was so much of the city. So many of the murals
          too. There are some murals that are still around, that were around when I was a kid, believe it or not. There
          is one here, in the Eastern market area, that is still around. And I remember seeing it when I was a young
          person.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Which one?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. The one that's right here [pointing it out to me].</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. On the gray wall?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Yes, off the service drive. The guy with a watermelon on his high-low. That's been there ever since I can
          remember. Matter of fact I was very young, but I watched some of the construction of the Renaissance being
          built. This was an impactful experience and I remember being in awe at how tall and scary the scaffolding
          looked as it seemed to reach into the clouds… at least that's how it looked to my young eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. What do you think about your history as a musician? And does it have any bearing on this project?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Without a doubt, music is deeply intertwined with my art. Its integration can vary – there are times when I
          consciously choose to emphasize it and times when I might not. In my upcoming exhibition, a few installations
          will resonate with my music peers, while others might not grasp the connections as readily. My journey is
          marked by daily experiments in art, music, and observation, which continually expand my artistic practice.
          While each day contributes to this growth, the support of collaborative efforts and thoughtful curation allows
          my insights to flourish and gain visibility.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Could you comment on the title of the exhibit you choose? “After The Dance”? That is definitely a musical
          title choice.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Yes, After the Dance, yes. It's from a Marvin Gaye song “After the Dance”. I always remember liking it. And
          throughout my career, especially after doing a gig or performances, I have to decompress. And I would always
          decompress with a certain type of music. Something very… less bombastic, mellow. And that's what I would
          listen to “After the Dance”. It is something very soothing. And I started to conceptualize and think more and
          more about life after dance music. What's after? Literally. What comes after the dance music moment? The
          moment. And also within my career. Both -a duality. And this track title just really resonated with me, “After
          the Dance”. It just has such a lyrical feel to it. I would go out after the pandemic and people were like
          “Scott, where have you been? I haven't seen you out. Haven't seen you playing!”. Well, in my mind I was
          exploring life after the dance. I was painting. I was thinking about ideas.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Detroit techno has always been about imagination and inspiration too. How do you find inspiration for your
          visual arts?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. It can come from anywhere. I get so much inspiration from nature, there isn't one piece of art that I've
          created that nature did not do first and better. I'm really into the study of Biomimetics, it's fascinating to
          me. During the lockdown I spent so much time riding my bike and looking at nature programs on YouTube. Birds
          and fish have some of the best color combinations I have ever seen, period. But then there is the vastness of
          space, that's also a much-needed inspiration for me at times.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. And how about the technological aspect of it also? How do you connect your art to the technological aspect
          of the music that you make?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I strongly recall my admiration for other artists and their visual aesthetics. The Cybotron album, for
          instance, left a strong impression on me.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I was definitely feeling Kraftwerk and their visual presentation. Their visual aesthetic is so strong that
          if you were to enlist Kraftwerk to paint your living room, I believe you can already imagine the result
          [laughs]. Their compelling visual style is so distinct that their signature might not even be necessary. The
          same can be said for Cybotron.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. For sure! How's your relationship to visual art evolved over the last three decades?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. Wow, that's a long time. It's been three decades!</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. [laughs] Oui. Did you have any classical art education?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. No, I didn't.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Tell me about this relationship with visual art please.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Before it was there, I would say it was more acoustic, it was more quiet. I would do things visually in a
          quieter way. But then I started to push the visuals a little bit more out there. And as it relates to this
          upcoming exhibition at Red Door Digital, it has totally been amplified. Now it's like when Dylan went electric
          [laughs]. First, he was acoustic and then he plugged the guitar into an amp. And I think about that because I
          have seen that documentary about him a couple of years ago. And I thought “that's like my art”. Now my art, it
          was acoustic for a long time. It was just something that I was just doing here and there. When I released my
          music, I would think of the visual artwork for it, and then work with my graphic designer to come up with
          something unique. And since 1999, I've been designing my own t-shirts. I've been visual for a while, just more
          or less acoustic with it.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          But now it is as if, like I said, related to this installation that I am working on that is coming up
          actually, things are a bit more amplified. And that is mainly because I am working with a very good curator -
          Elysia Borowy. And she is helping me amplify that visual side of me. And that is part of my creative process.
          My creative process for the art, it's still very improvisational. It's still uncharted. But when showing it to
          the world and showing it to people, I do go through, I do have a certain technique, you would say to speak. I
          like to transport ideas from my studio to a space. And in doing so, something will change. Whenever you
          transport a move art and try to install it, something changes. I can remember when I was doing the exhibition
          at Filter, this past May, I experienced that. And there were a couple of pieces that I did right there on the
          spot. Because whenever you transport the art, there is gonna be some type of change. Also because of the
          space. The space dictates and may change how you set up your art.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Completely. How did the space change your art? Or how did it influence it?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. The way it looks, those bricks. The bricks gave me an idea of a piece that I want to do there. That's in
          relation to the bricks. First, I transport the art from one place to another. And there is a change. But then
          the part that is very important is the amplification. And that's where I feel I needed help. I needed help to
          amplify what I did visually. And I can honestly say that displaying my work at Filter Detroit with Kirsten
          helped me amplify what I was doing. And for a lot of people during that exhibition, they didn't even know I
          did art. Because I was acoustic. Very quiet. So, you know, we amplified it. But then this upcoming exhibition
          at Red Door will be amplified even more because the space is bigger. I am looking forward to that. The
          curation process is key because that helps you amplify. Same thing with rock and roll, as I look back,
          musically. You know, with music, guitars having amps, going from acoustic to amps helped amplify that genre of
          music to being heard and to being seen. Like I said, I am looking forward to this exhibition and it being
          amplified to a degree where people can take notice and see where my imagination has led me.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. This other question is connected. How did art find you? How did you find art? Where did this outpouring of
          creativity come from?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. As I mentioned earlier, a portion of this inclination arises from necessity and the environment I grew up
          in. Imagination, I believe, is innate within all of us. The question becomes, how do we amplify it? The beauty
          lies in the fact that each person's imagination is uniquely their own. It's a personal and unclaimed
          territory, impervious to outside interference. It's a realm that belongs solely to the individual, and it's a
          tool that can transport us to places beyond the physical realm. For me, my imagination has been a lifelong
          companion, originating from my formative years. Even back then, I was drawn to tinkering and crafting things
          to engage with, which helped start my artistic journey. I have vivid memories of my earliest days of school,
          where drawing and painting were clear as if it happened yesterday. Remarkably, even if I hadn't possessed
          sight, I'm certain art would still be present in my world. It has been an integral part of my identity for as
          long as I can recall.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          Engaging in the act of creating positive imagery serves as a method to counteract negative thoughts at times.
          The beauty lies in the fact that the outcome need not resemble anything specific; it's an expression of what I
          feel. This outpouring of creativity blossomed through an environment that didn't place emphasis on lofty
          ideals, allowing me to thrive within my own self-constructed settings.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Did your art allow you to find this imagination?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I can't even imagine it not being there. You're making me think about how life would have been without art.
          Oh, man. I can't even tell you. I can't separate them. I don't know what it would be. I can't even tell you
          what it would be like for me not to have an artistic life growing up.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. How would you describe your development as an artist in terms of interests and challenges? Searching for a
          personal voice.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I thought about that. The more and more I started to paint every day I began to think more with my eyes as
          opposed to music where I think with my ears. Not to mention getting opportunities to display my work at FILTER
          Detroit, Spotlite and the upcoming show at Red Door Digital all helped me develop artistically as well.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. What challenges you as an artist, Scott?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Oh man, that's a good question as well. Well, sometimes the idea. I'll think of something that I physically
          have to think about how I would do it. So, there's some trial and error there because every idea, I can't
          always make it manifest itself into something physical, not always. I have challenges because when I'm working
          at home, I'm working in a relatively small space. That's a challenge in itself. When I go on YouTube and I
          look at artists and I'm like, man, this studio is just huge! They have so much room to operate in.
          Interrupting my own flow of redundancy seems to be one of my greatest challenges in both music and art.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. You're starting to have quite an important body of work now.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. Yes. I have a certain thing that I do.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Do you get rid of anything?</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. Well when you turn the recording off, I tell you [laughs]. I tell you a secret.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Okay. What would you say are the key ideas behind your approach to art? That is connected to another
          conversation we had recently, where you mentioned “architect”, “colorist”, and “explorer” as the three worlds
          that would best describe your work.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I would think so. Yeah, I didn't go to school for architecture, but, you know, it's a part of my process.
          How things are built, how they're designed. I grew up around a lot of Detroit classic architecture as a kid. I
          saw it. And of course, I've always loved color. I was surrounded by color. My grandmother was really into
          flowers. That was her thing. There’s nothing like the color of the flower. Like I go to the paint store, and
          nothing comes close. I have always been like a colorist. I have always been into color. That’s another one of
          my pillars. And I have to explore because my imagination hasn't been mapped or charted by me.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. You're an explorer of your own mind. S. I'm an explorer of my own mind. That was one of my earliest
          memories as a kid. I had to do a report on Matthew Henson. He was an explorer. I just remember that to this
          day. And me, I'm an explorer of my own imagination because it hasn't been mapped. I don't know where things
          are. It hasn’t been charted. No one has been there except me. And that keeps me going every day because there
          is so much to explore and connect with what you already know about yourself, and with your environment growing
          up.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Art is self-exploration.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I engage in this routine every single day. It's a daily commitment. I delve into exploration, seeking out
          discoveries, and engaging in conversations with others about my findings. This interaction, too, is an
          integral aspect of the process. Surprisingly, even during the lockdown, YouTube emerged as a valuable resource
          for art education. It allowed me to learn about diverse artists, various artistic movements, and different
          periods. In a way, I attended 'YouTube University' and, while I can't claim a formal graduation, the
          experience truly put me up on a lot of subjects. This is a daily practice. I engage with art, I explore
          various subjects, and at times, I notice my keyboard gathering dust. When I return to music after this hiatus,
          I feel rejuvenated. Even while taking a step back, creativity continues to flow. I can temporarily detach and
          still maintain productivity.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          It's worth saying again that what felt somewhat beyond my control—rightfully so—is the amplification of my
          work. The unexpected opportunity arose as people expressed interest in showcasing my ideas and artwork. This
          wasn't something I had anticipated. Initially, my art served as a form of personal therapy, a daily routine.
          The notion of amplification hadn't factored into my thoughts.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. That's organic.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Yeah, it was! It was not my initial intention but a fellow artist from Hamburg named Richard, was visiting
          Detroit and he invited me to come see his musical performance in Hamtramck. I went to his performance and
          that's how I met Kirsten from Filter Detroit. We struck up a friendship and a few months later, I was showing
          my work at Filter to Detroit. And in doing that, I met Elysia. And she presented an opportunity for me to show
          my work on a more ambitious scale. This is exactly how it happened, and it happened here in Detroit in a very
          organic way. Because so much of it is out of my control. People helping you plug in, that's important. That’s
          how you build solid roots, it is a real connection.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Yes you wanted to include people in this process.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I found a way to do that. Yes, absolutely. I did find a way. But I came up with a way that is kind of
          radical. And like I said, I will tell you. But I also started very early on to show my work to a few people. I
          would send some stuff. Then I compiled my earliest stuff into an art journal in 2021. That was me slowly
          trying to amp up. I really did it because as a kid I remember loving catalogs. I remember my grandmother would
          give me old catalogs, catalogs with clothes, with instruments. I couldn't afford it, but I could turn the page
          and look at it. I loved that. So, I wanted to make an art catalog. And I wanted my art to be seen there first.
          Turning the page.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Talking about the art process, over the course of your development, what have been your most important
          tools and materials? And what are the most promising strategies for working with them?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S.That's indeed an excellent question. I wish you could see the variety of tools I employ. I work with a
          multitude of tools and experiment with numerous materials. Similarly, I paint on various surfaces, something
          that traces back to my early experiences. During my childhood, my mother displayed impressive resourcefulness,
          utilizing what was available and adapting as needed. This adaptable mindset became a part of my upbringing.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          My creative process starts with an initial idea or a search for inspiration. Occasionally, I sketch until the
          subject gradually emerges, and then comes the inevitable moment of error. However, this mistake often paves
          the way for unique ideas, perspectives should not be fixed.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          While my studio is compact, I've learned to view this constraint as a positive constraint. Although the
          physical space is limited, the concepts I work with are expansive in my mind. This influences how I perceive
          the work, which colors I opt for, and how I introduce elements without altering the dimensions.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Would you say that these past few years making arts, made you develop a preference for a material or tool?
          Or are you still exploring?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. Yeah, I'm still very much exploring the different tools that I like to use. But I think my breakthrough
          moment was learning how to use the tool of gravity. I found out that gravity is a tremendous tool. I have this
          technique, and I showed a couple of the pieces at my "Free Jazz” exhibition that were made totally by way of
          gravity. I think you saw the video. I came up with a tool that I haven't seen anyone else use in relation to
          their art. It got me really, really excited. I didn't think of myself as the creator of that piece. It made me
          think that gravity created that piece. And it helped give me a lot of balance because in my music side of
          things, as a DJ, it is all about the opposite, control. But when I started to incorporate gravity in my art,
          it was about letting go. That was a new thing for me. Not being the creator of everything. It was letting it
          go and then seeing what happens when you let go. I will put a short video clip on my website that shows this
          technique of using gravity.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Looking forward to seeing that. One last question please. Creativity can reach many different corners of
          our lives. You spoke about that. Do you feel as though creating a painting or an album cover is inherently
          different from something like making a great cup of coffee, or a good croissant? What do you express through
          visuals that you couldn't or wouldn't in more mundane tasks?
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. That's a great question. That tells you, that tells me something, that creativity plays a role. See now
          you're going to have me thinking about that the next time I vacuum the floor [laughs]. You make me think
          artistically. Because honestly, I didn't appreciate the beauty that I grew up in in my neighborhood as a kid,
          like I do now. It was first of all so abundant. I grew up in an abundantly rich environment for visual
          stimulation. Like I said, my grandmother planted flowers. We had three or four fruit trees. Color was
          everywhere. Architecture was everywhere. My father was an artist. It was all around me. And somehow all I
          could think about was getting a new pair of Adidas. You know, sneaker culture and the visual. So, I didn't
          appreciate a lot of the visual environment that I grew up in then.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. But I feel like it's always the case.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">S. That's always the case.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. You appreciate the new, the different.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. You appreciate it being marketed too. Like I didn't appreciate what was natural around me. As much as I
          probably should have.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          A. Exactly. It’s our everyday, you know. Same as true for me and Paris. It's like an everyday routine in which
          I grew up.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. I can relate to that, much like my experience when I visited Athens, Greece for the first time. I was
          eagerly anticipating seeing the ruins, only to encounter a local resident who seemed quite indifferent,
          describing them as 'just old rocks.' This contrast highlights how our perspectives are shaped by the
          environments we grew up in. My upbringing revolved around a lifestyle of daily creativity, a facet that
          continues to be an integral part of who I am. I maintain that mindset even now; every day, I engage in the
          playground of the mind, exploring diverse avenues to keep it alive. However, the transition from my personal
          studio to a shared space necessitated a shift, requiring collaboration with others to amplify my ideas. This
          alteration introduced structure, a change that has positively influenced my thought processes. Collaborating
          with individuals in the city who comprehend how my creativity, resourcefulness, and imagination function has
          been immensely valuable. While it's not as though I have a full staff, there's a close-knit circle in which I
          can brainstorm ideas. This network provides a conduit for my concepts to flow into, fostering a productive
          environment. This setup has greatly benefitted my creativity; I'm able to think, and sometimes, even in the
          middle of the night, send an idea via email, confident that there's an established structure to amplify it.
          This setup prompts me to reflect on the significance of structures in art history and how pivotal they were
          for the development of the artists we recognize today.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Always, always.</p>
        <p class="pt-8">
          S. It helped me understand something. It's always about meetings, about transmission, about connections
          between people. I can appreciate that.
        </p>
        <p class="pt-8">A. Thank you very much Scott! I can’t wait to see the exhibition.</p>
